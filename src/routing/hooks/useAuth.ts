// const useAuth = () => ({ user: { id: 1, name: 'Mosh' } });

const useAuth = () => ({ user: null });

export default useAuth;



//  this is hook for getting the current user 


//  this is basically for purely for demonstration purpose 
// this is not how we return the current user in real application 


//  there are two implimentation 
            // 1st we return the user 
            // 2nd we return user without the detaisl means user not logged in 




// now go to userPage.tsx
